# Smarty Contracts

A smart contract suite for smart people

## Overview

Pre-print resources have been available online for years, such as the University of Cornell's arXiv, but the decreasing disruptive power of academic research has allowed predatory journals to fill the void between these resources and properly reviewed primary literature.  Smarty Contracts seeks to provide a more equitable balance between the need to "publish or perish" and the efficient use of academic resources.  The use of ad-hoc teams of citizen scientists within wider academic affiliation has been demonstrated with projects such as SETI@Home for the use of computing resources, but the wider use of human resources to spur creativity within data exploration and hypothecation has been overlooked.

### Project Risks

Allowing for flexibility of cloud and locally-hosted publishing software may present significant obstacles towards full decentralization.

Gas fee networks are necessary for the storage costs, which may or may not confer advantage over traditional academic research digital object storage.
